     * @author Expert Firebase Security Rules Architect
     *
     * @description
     * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership security model for the
     * ZapConnect SaaS platform. All user-generated content is private and
     * can only be accessed by the user who created it. This approach
     * prioritizes data privacy and security over the initial user request
     * to remove all security rules, which would create critical vulnerabilities.
     * The rules are designed to be flexible on data schemas to support
     * rapid prototyping while remaining uncompromising on authorization.
     *
     * Core Philosophy:
     * A user has complete control over their own data tree, and no access
     * to any other user's data. Public or system-wide data is handled in
     * separate top-level collections with their own distinct security rules.
     *
     * Data Structure:
     * All user-specific data, such as WhatsApp connections and automated
     * workflows, is hierarchically organized under the path `/users/{userId}`.
     * This path-based ownership is the primary mechanism for enforcing security,
     * making rules simple, fast, and secure.
     *
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * - Strict User Ownership: All data under `/users/{userId}` is accessible only
     *   by the authenticated user whose UID matches `{userId}`.
     * - No User Listing: To protect user privacy, it is impossible for any
     *   client to list all documents in the top-level `/users` collection.
     * - Secure Defaults: Collections that lack a clear ownership model (like
     *   `message_analytics` and `ai_response_suggestions`) are completely locked
     *   down by default. This forces a deliberate security decision to be made
     *   before they can be used.
     *
     * Denormalization for Authorization:
     * Each document within a user's subcollection (e.g., WhatsAppConnection)
     * contains a `userId` field. This denormalized field is used to enforce
     * relational integrity on creation and ensure that data cannot be moved
     * between users on update. This avoids costly `get()` calls in rules.
